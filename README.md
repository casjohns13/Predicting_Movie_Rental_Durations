# 15. Predicting Movie Rental Durations

Build a regression model for a DVD rental firm to predict rental duration. Evaluate models to recommend the best one.

Time to put your regression knowledge to the test! A DVD rental company has approached you to make a regression model which will help predict the number of days a customer rents a DVD. The model will hopefully make their inventory planning much more efficient. You decide to help them by running some regression models and recommending the best-performing model to the company.
